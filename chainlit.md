# Chabot Assistant

Are you building an intent based chatbot? Use this tool to quickly generate training phrases and a chatbot response for any intent.

## How it works:

Describe the intent you would like to generate training data for. Then provide information so the chatbot response is accurate.

**User**: The intent is cancel. Users can cancel their account by clicking the profile, selcting account settings, and selecting the red cancel button at the bottom of the page.

**Chatbot Assistant**:

Training Phrases for the "Cancel" Intent:

1. "I want to cancel my account."
2. "How can I deactivate my profile?"
3. "I'd like to stop using this service."
4. "Can you guide me to cancel my account?"
5. "I need to terminate my account."
6. "What's the process to cancel my account?"
7. "I wish to discontinue my account."
8. "I'm thinking of cancelling my account."
9. "I need help with account cancellation."
10. "Guide me through the account deactivation process."

These phrases are appropriate because they all express the user's intent to cancel or deactivate their account. They use different language and phrasing, but the underlying intent is the same.

**_Bot Response_**: "I'm sorry to hear that you want to cancel your account. You can do this by clicking on your profile, selecting 'Account Settings', and then clicking the red 'Cancel' button at the bottom of the page. If you need any further assistance, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š"
